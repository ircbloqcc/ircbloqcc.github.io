When loading a project with a extension, an error will be reported and cannot be loaded. The input box of the variable increase block is parsed incorrectly when other blocks or variables are placed. In the double-numbered character, the movement blocks in the toolbox area will not automatically change to the coordinates of the character's current position. Fix the problem that esp32 and esp8266 cannot start after clicking the reset button when connecting to ircBloq due to the lack of serial port to enable dtr rts flow control. After connecting and disconnecting the device once in upload mode, no matter what mode is connected to the device again, it will not be able to establish communication with the connection firmata. ESP32 and ESP8266 will get stuck for a long time between compiling and uploading. v4.0.3 \u00b6 New feature Add Kit filter option to device selection. Add the option to cancel the device selection. When loading a project containing unknown devices and plug-ins, the error details will be reported. Update the device picture according to the new picture standard. Automatically obtain the control board pin list in external extensions. Add slider type blocks. Extension can be auto sorted if enabled. Fix bug Fixed ESP Boards DTR/RTS Issues. The serial port send button is collapsed in small window mode. Modify the default installation path of the desktop version of windows to the root directory of C drive instead of the deep directory of user data. If there is an unsupported device id in the external device list, the device model will be empty. Because the vm building block adds the device type in front of the optype, the display variable cannot be translated normally. Esp8266 digital pin cannot select GPIO16. Check the checkbox so that the variable will be displayed in the stage area, and it will still exist after switching the device. Arduino ceil function name error. The microbit attitude option is not translated. Microbit uses multiple while true statements that are not supported. When using the scroll wheel to move the toolbox, the completely displayed blocks beyond the boundary are blocked again. Color picker function is not available. The disconnection error alert flashes after switching the mode. When using a third-party device, the alert uses the mother board instead of the picture of the third-party device board. V4.0.2 \u00b6 **New feature IMPORVED NEW UI, Supports SCARTCH 3 Based Extensions. Added Blynk IOT, ADAFRUIT IO, LOCALSERVER, THINGSPEAK SERVER FOR NODEMCU boards Improved Some bug fix Added Serial communication Blocks in all Boards. New feature Add Kit filter option to device selection. Add the option to cancel the device selection. When loading a project containing unknown devices and plug-ins, the error details will be reported. Update the device picture according to the new picture standard. Automatically obtain the control board pin list in external extensions. Add slider type blocks. Optimized the devil bird svg image.

The disconnection error alert flashes after switching the mode. When using a third-party device, the alert uses the mother board instead of the picture of the third-party device board. New feature Add esp8266 and makey makey support. Add a button to show all connectable device. Prevent users from being unable to connect to the device when using a USB-to-serial chip that is not included. Add file associations for .ib project file. Fix bug Severe freeze after switching targets several times. The remote resource update address configuration error caused the program to crash after clicking the Check Update button. The remote resource update address incorrectly uses ircbloqcc instead of the address in the configuration. When the blocks nested inside the blocks in the toolbox are in the workspace, the internal blocks are erroneously disabled when the disabled state is updated. An error is reported after opening multiple windows: the address is already in use. New feature Change arduino build tool from arduino-builder to arduino-cli. Add remote upgrade function for external extension and device. Modify the default sprite to Demon Bird. Add arduino esp32 board support. Add microbit V2 board support. Add clear cache button. Add install driver button. Move the real-time mode connection indicator to the stage head. Add localization for desktop alters. Add timeout error in upload modal. If it gets stuck for tens of seconds, it will show timeout error, allow users to click the close button but not stuck forever. Add arduino uno ultra base board to support customized board witch A6 A7 pins. Optimize the external extension and device framwork. Optimize the firmware files structure. Optimize the serialport framwork. Prevent interface freeze caused by receiving high-speed serialport data. Add QDP ROBOT C02 kit(arduino esp32). Fix bug Stuck at the upload modal if unplug the usb cable while in arduino build progress. Unplug the usb cable while in arduino upload progress, the gui does not disconnect the device. User could still click the upload button and then will stuck in upload modal. Uploading the program or firmware after connecting and disconnecting the device several times will cause the real-time mode communication bug. After the upload is successful, if user do not close the upload window, unplug the usb cable, it will display upload failure. New feature Add serilport console. Separate third party device from bundle pack. now support modify third party device without rebuild the project. Optimize the block's disable logic in different programming modes. Now in realtime mode, you can select the realtime mode extension. If a block is not connected into the effective tree. it's setup and define and others code will not generate. Optimize the structure of the code generated by Arduino code generator to make it more consistent with Arduino native code format. The project file will save the current programming mode and automatically switch to the saved mode after loading. In programming mode, blocks can no longer be click executed and glow. After the realtime mode communication is successfully established, there will be no atert. Instead, it will indicate whether the communication is successful by dimming the communication icon on the right side of the connection icon. A alter will pop up and prompt to download the real-time mode firmware only after the communication attempt fails. After the firmware is downloaded and the real-time communication is established successfully, the alert of real-time mode failure warning will automatically disappear. Fix bug When loading a project file with multiple large extensions, the toolbar area will repeatedly display the contents of multiple extensions, and some other errors. The button to download firmware is not disabled when there is no connected device. Shorten the window of upload to fix the problem of incomplete display on some pc. Fixed a number of potential problems with realtime mode communication. The code window is not re rendered after resizing, resulting in a missing display. After switching programming mode, the sprite will disappear in some times. Arduino and microbit do not hide all the unsupported building blocks in programming mode. Microbit's buttonIsPressed block transcoding function should have written n for b when button is B. Microbit custom variable name exception. Arduino UNO mega2560 serial port 0 translation code is incorrect. Number parsing error of data_changevariableby block. Cancel the 1.05x interface zoom setting and directly enlarge the font to fix the problem of blurred font in the toolbar menu. New feature Add hide code stage button. Change the ui of upload button. Change the description of some boards. Add a 1.05 scale to fix the problem of fuzzy font. Change project file extension from .sb3 to .ib. Fix bug Microbit generator error. The pin menu of arduino set digital out does not have analog pin items. Fix bug Third party's block which from vm code generator error. New feature Now most alert will automaticly disapear after 5s. Completed the blocks of microbit. Add a servo extension as demo for microbit. After installing the new version of the software, the old cache will be cleared automatically. Fix bug Error usb hardware id of cp2102. Error translation of microbit. Cannot scan to devices after loading a project. The loaded device extension still exists after switching the device selection. New feature Blocks could over flow the flyout boundary when mouse enter. Extension can be auto loaded when device selected.
